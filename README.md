# Russia's War VHS Packaging Scans And Nero CoverDesigner (.ncd) DVD Inlay Files

The Russia's War VHS packaging was scanned to make DVD inlays in Nero CoverDesigner. This repository contains; 1.) the Russia's War VHS packaging scans, and 2.) the Nero CoverDesiger (.ncd) DVD inlay files.

Nero CoverDesigner is used to create custom disc labels, jewel case inlays, booklets and much more for your CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. Nero CoverDesigner is typically, but not always, bundled with Nero Platinum. Because Nero CoverDesigner was not always bundled with Nero Platinum, Nero decided to provide Nero CoverDesigner as a free standalone installer at https://www.nero.com/enu/downloads/. Scroll down the page to find it.

Screenshots of the DVD inlay files opened in Nero CoverDesigner are included (NOTE: Near bottom left of screenshot, DVD Inlay tab is selected. DVD Booklet and Disc 1 were not made.):
